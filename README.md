# Sci-Annot Evaluation Component
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sci-annot-eval.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/sci-annot-eval)

This package was developed as part of my master's thesis and used in the evaluation stage.

It produces per-page confusion matrices with multiple classes for predictions in the field of Object Detection, with inter-object dependencies also supported.

# Installation
This tool is packaged under the name [sci-annot-eval](https://pypi.org/project/sci-annot-eval/).

You can install it like `pip install sci-annot-eval`, or `conda install sci-annot-eval`.

# Development Setup
If you wish to work on this project locally, you'll need:
- python3.9+
- pipenv

To set up the dependencies, just run `pipenv install` in the project root.
From that point on, you can do `pipenv shell`, which will launch your custom python environment with all of the dependencies installed.

## TODO
Fix logging
